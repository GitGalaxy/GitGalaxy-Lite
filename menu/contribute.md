Getting your contributions onto Git Galaxy is easy. Because we operate on GitHub Pages, all that is required is for you to fork the repository, write an article following Jekyll guide to [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), and then create a new pull request. Your article will be reviewed by an editor, and merged into the site.

We expect articles are less about self-promotion and more focused on technical details or experiences you have had, and we do not limit contributions to just open source _software_ - we are more than happy to publish articles regarding any form of open source.
