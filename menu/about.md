__Welcome to Git Galaxy__

We are a group of writers dedicated to covering open source projects and initiatives around the world,
encouraing open source contributions and journaling our own experiences with our projects
and ideas.

We currently operate this blog on GitHub Pages (you can read about this decision [here](https://gist.github.com/gmemstr/d5f493bbf92978dacd6eeb5f131e5541)), and welcome absolutely anyone to contribute, through either pull requests or issues. Moving forward, we hope we can grow a strong community of open source enthousiats and use the platfom as a means of furthering the spirit of open source.
