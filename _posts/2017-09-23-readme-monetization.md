title: 'README: Monetization'

It should be no secret that Git Galaxy is sort of a money sink right now, with
no monetization enabled. This changes today.

First, to the uninitiated, let's talk about why  this is such an important move.
For months now I have been running Git Galaxy out of my own pocket, financing
this startup with my own capital. While it could easily run for a while, it
simply is not practical. This site is loosing money, while ideally it should be
breaking even. That's all we really want - making a profit is not a priority,
and all money is funneled right back into the site, whether it be investing in
better infrastructure, adding on talented writers to our roster, or partnering
with other publications for exclusive content.

For a while now, I've considered implementing different methods of monetizing
the site. Initially, I wanted to use plain old Adsense, and while it's not
ideal, it works. We know a large portion of our audience uses adblock anyways
(or at least expect it), but it's an easy way to monetize. We will only be
running ads inside posts that authors opt in to, so they can decide what posts
they would like to run ads and where specifically to run them. Ads in guest
posts will contribute to the author, while posts by staff that contain ads will
contribute back to the site. Ads will look like the one below:



We have also set up a page to support Datajoy's "F-U, PAY ME"
[https://datajoy.us/fupm.html], and plan to leave it enabled to see how it goes.
It's roughly 1¢/visit, and their DNS does adblocking as well. We recommend you
try it out (we are not sponsored by them, but believe it's a promising project).

Lastly, but certainly not least, we're opening up a Patreon
[https://patreon.com/gitgalaxy]. Yes, it's become a cliché at this point, but
it's proven to be a good platform for people to support creatives. We don't have
many tiers yet, but it's important to note that it's aimed more to replace the
ads, and let any reader contribute back to us.

We hope to continue investigating ways of monetizing our content without
detracting from the experience or quality of our articles.
