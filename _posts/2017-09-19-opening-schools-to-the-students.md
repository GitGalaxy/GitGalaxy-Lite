title: Opening Schools to the Students
---

Recently, due to a serious of unfortunate events, I have had to re-enroll in
high school to finish up my high school diploma. While most people see the
school system as outdated and old-fashioned, some even seeing the individual
curriculum as outdated. It can be frustrating to know that as a student it's
difficult to get these changed, as the majority of the time the requirements are
laid out by the government. This could be drastically improved by using the
concept of open source to the school advantage, utilizing existing tools to
allow students around the country to contribute to what should become a much
more "optimized" learning curriculum.

First, open source text books. These already exist, widely available on the
Internet, however traditional school can be slow to pick them up for a variety
of reasons, including factors like the fact a lot of school already have an
existing stockpile of textbooks that the teachers - and district as well - know
and can build and reuse material around it. It's also likely that some schools
are wary of the technology, opting to use more traditional and reliable physical
books. However, there have been many campaigns to attempt to push schools in the
right direction, including the #GoOpen [https://tech.ed.gov/open/]  Campaign in
the United States, and Canada's Open Education Initiative
