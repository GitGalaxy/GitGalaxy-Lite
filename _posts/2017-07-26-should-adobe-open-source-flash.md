title: Should Adobe Open Source Flash
---

It's no secret that Adobe Flash is being killed off.

For a while now Flash has been going down the slow painful road of obsolescence.
Since Chrome 55, HTML5 has been the prefered experience for users1, and we've
seen sites like YouTube rewrite their Flash portions to take advantage of HTML5
standards. While HTML5 standards surge in popularity and we find new ways of
taking advantage of JavaScript and CSS, Flash has fallen far behind, among
security issues2  and continued criticism for it being a completely closed and
proprietary platform.

The final nail in the coffin has come, however. Adobe themselves are completely
dropping Flash by the year 20203, finally putting an end to Flash, once and for
all. While no doubt older websites will continue to use it, whether it be lack
of continued support or just because "it's easier", moving forward we will
undoubtedly lose large portions of internet, or at the very least the ability to
use whatever functionality they provided.

However, there is a new push to encourage Adobe to release the source code
behind Flash on GitHub. A petition, in the form of stars, has been created by
user pakastin, and at the time of writing is rising rapidly in popularity. The
purpose would be to "...keep Flash projects alive safely for archive reasons", a
noble goal indeed. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/pakastin/open-source-flash), where a star counts as a single
vote in the petition. It will be interesting to see how Adobe reacts, and we
will reach out to the creator to see if he has any statements.

There is hope Flash could live on, even as a legacy open source repository of
code, which could be invaluable to some.
