So for the past couple weeks, I have been working on a podcasting platform  app
in [Go](https://golang.org/)  (one of the programming languages by Google) that
can automatically generate a podcast RSS feed based on a flat-file directory
structure.

Basically how it works is by using specially formatted episode names to parse
out info for the episode, and pull info for the description from the 
\_SHOWNOTES.md file corresponding to it. It's very basic but I wanted to avoid
more "complex" deployment requirements like an RDBMS or the like. Using a format
like this means human-readable file names for downloads, which are very likely
to occur for a podcast listener. For the time being, shownotes are plain
Markdown files, unparsed (for now), however while writing this I am
contemplating moving them to JSON or HTML (whichever is easier to embed in an
RSS feed item).

When a file is changed, the [fsnotify/fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify)
package triggers an event that regenerates two files - feed.rss 
and feed.json. It may seem odd that I am generating two file of essentially 
the same data, however it's for a reason I
feel comfortable with - JSON parsing is much easier for JavaScript-based
development (and many other languages), whereas XML parsing may be a bit more
rare.

The RSS generated does work fine, and I tested it using the Podcast Addict
Android app (I usually use Pocket Casts however PA is much easier to test with).
The [W3 Feed Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/) does complain a
bit (mostly about URLs not matching), but it does work.

Now the more difficult part - implementing the special iTunes tags to make
podcasts more discoverable on platforms. I am opting for iTunes tags over Google
Play tags for the simple fact of I'm not sure if iTunes likes <googleplay:*> 
tags, but I do know for a fact Google is fine with parsing Apple's tags.

This implementation is taking the form of a fork of the [gorilla/feeds](https://github.com/gorilla/feeds). This library is mostly aimed for traditional
blog-based RSS feeds, without the fancy iTunes tags (or even working <image> 
tags as I discovered). Since I have completed the core functionality of the
actual feed generation, that has become my primary focus.

That said, I am planning on deploying the base application to the server soon so
that you guys can see a working version of the app, and also so I can start
playing around with actual audio podcasts!

Of course the entire development of the app is open source,
and you can follow along and try it out yourself here: [gmemstr/whiterabbit](https://github.com/gmemstr/whiterabbit). You'll need to go get  a couple
requirements, otherwise it's fairly straightforward.

README is a short informative post aimed to inform readers about changes and
progress behind the scenes.
