title: A Look at Hacktoberfest
---

DigitalOcean and Github have teamed up to encourage people to contribute to open
source - but what exactly is "Hacktoberfest", and what does it mean for the
larger Github community?

Let's talk about the two companies behind this. There's Github, the well known
and massively popular git repository hosting platform on which the competition
is being run, and DigitalOcean, a well known player in the virtual private
server space. They have teamed up with one (well a few if you count marketing)
goal in mind: Encouraging people to help out other open source projects.

The way the fest is set up is pretty straightforward. You sign up on their
website [https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/]  by linking your Github
account, then from October 1st to the 31st you need to make four pull requests
to any  Github-hosted repository (I've reached out to DigitalOcean to confirm
they just have to be made, not accepted), and you will recieve a limited edition
Hacktoberfest t-shirt. Contributions are not limited to issues tagged
"hacktoberfest", and absolutely anyone with a Github account can get signed up
regardless of how old the account is.
